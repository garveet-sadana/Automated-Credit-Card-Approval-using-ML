# Credit Card Approval Prediction App

This app predicts the probability of an applicant being approved for a credit card without affecting their credit score. Every time an applicant makes a hard enquiry (applying for a credit card), their credit score is negatively affected. This app allows applicants to check if they are likely to be approved for a credit card without performing any hard enquiry on their credit.

## Features

- **No Impact on Credit Score**: Predict the likelihood of credit card approval without triggering a hard enquiry.
- **Machine Learning Model**: Uses a machine learning model to predict approval based on the applicant's features.
- **User-Friendly**: Simple interface to get predictions based on input data.

## How It Works

The app uses a machine learning model trained on relevant data to predict the probability of credit card approval. It analyzes input features such as income, credit history, age, and other factors, and gives a predicted probability of approval.

### Use Case

This app is helpful for individuals who want to estimate their chances of getting a credit card approval without impacting their credit score. It can be used to make informed decisions before making formal applications.
